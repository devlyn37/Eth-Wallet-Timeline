# Contributing to Safety Goggles

Thanks for thinking of contributing!

## We use Github

Github is where we host code, track issues, and manage feature requests. Any additions or fixes to Safety Goggles are managed through pull requests.

## Branching strategies, deployment, and contributing.

We use something similar to Github Flow, but we also maintain a dev branch. Anything pushed to main is automatically deployed to production. Currently, there's not a lot of testing, so the dev branch acts as a buffer for new releases. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`.
2. Make sure your code lints and builds (This is checked automatically in all PRs).
3. run prettier `npm run prettier-format`
4. [Issue your pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) against the `dev` branch!

Eventually, there will be testing requirements, but not yet.

## Bugs and Enhancements are handled with [Github issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)

If you'd like to report a bug or request a new feature/improvement [create an issue](https://github.com/devlyn37/Safety-Goggles/issues), labeling each as either a bug or an enhancement respectively. This is also a good place to look for things to do!
